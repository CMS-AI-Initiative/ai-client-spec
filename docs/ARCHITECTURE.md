# Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for the language agnostic AI client specification. It is critical that it meets all [requirements](./REQUIREMENTS.md).

**Note:** As the primary focus for this specification is to facilitate AI usage in PHP, some of the underlying syntax used in this documentation may use PHP conventions. This does not hinder interoperability with other programming languages. Only PHP language capabilities that can be easily replicated in other relevant programming languages will be used.

## Class diagrams

This section shows comprehensive class diagrams for the proposed architecture. For explanation on specific terms, see the [glossary](./GLOSSARY.md).
