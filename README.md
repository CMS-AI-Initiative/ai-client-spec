# AI Client Specification

This repository defines the AI client specification, to enable calling any generative AI implementation using a uniform API in various programming languages.

**This is a work in progress.** Next steps are:

1. Define language agnostic requirements.
2. Define language agnostic architecture.
3. Explore PHP and client-side JavaScript/TypeScript implementations of architecture.
