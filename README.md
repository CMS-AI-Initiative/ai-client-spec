# AI Client Specification

This repository defines the AI client specification, to enable calling any generative AI implementation using a uniform API in various programming languages.

* [Glossary](https://github.com/CMS-AI-Initiative/ai-client-spec/blob/main/docs/GLOSSARY.md)
* [Requirements](https://github.com/CMS-AI-Initiative/ai-client-spec/blob/main/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md)
* [Architecture](https://github.com/CMS-AI-Initiative/ai-client-spec/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

**This is a work in progress.** Next steps are:

1. ~~Define language agnostic requirements.~~
2. Define language agnostic architecture.
3. Explore PHP and client-side JavaScript/TypeScript implementations of architecture.
